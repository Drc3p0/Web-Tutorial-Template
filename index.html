<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p class="section">
Welcome to the tutorial template site! You can use this as the
starting point for building and publishing your own tutorials on the MVSE
github site. The picture above is pinched from the stock digimakers photos
archives.
</p>

<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/another-page/"><h2>Another Template Page</h2></a>
<p class="section">
This page is here to show how we can create other pages on the site. It
exists in the <code>another-page</code> folder and is called 
<code>index.html</code>. It can be reached at the following URL:
"{{site.baseurl}}/another-page".
</p>

<h2>What now?</h2>
<p class="section">
So you've got yourself this repository as a template? What next?
</p>
<p>
The site works using the Jekyll static site generator, so their
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">tutorial pages</a> 
will be handy. Make sure that you update the jekyll <code>_config.yml</code>
file in the root of the repository to reflect who is writing the tutorial,
and what the title is.
</p>
<p>
After that - it's really down to you. You can create new pages, add a
sort of blog, images, code, the lot! Best of luck, and when in doubt,
ask on the MVSE facebook group.
</p>
<p>
Much love,
