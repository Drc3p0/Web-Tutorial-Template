Digimakers Web-based Tutorial Template
================================

This is the repository for the template of a web-based Digimakers tutorial. If your workshop doesis not able to be done using the (simplified) LaTeX template (see LaTeX-Worksheet-Templates repository) for example, because your workshop includes video, then please use this template to create a website based tutorial. 

Where possible, we like to use the LaTeX template as it allows us to upload and share PDFs on the Digimakers website and simplifies the task of taking workshops into schools (where websites, especially sites like Github, are frequently blocked).

If you are a teacher wishing to adapt any of these materials for use in lessons, please contact Ben Marshall, who's details are found at the end of the tutorial document, or Caroline Higgins who organises the [Digimakers events](http://www.digimakers.co.uk).
